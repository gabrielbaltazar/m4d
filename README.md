This is the repository of the migration framework for Delphi. 

### What is M4D? ###

M4D is the acronym for Migrations for Delphi.

### What is a migration? ###

A migration is a history of change, usually related to changes in the database. Most applications, especially if it is an enterprise application, have the need to create fields, triggers, procedures and other elements in your database. In addition, it may be necessary to generate auxiliary files within the file system. With migrations, you can manage these updates as well as maintain a history and the possibility of regressing with these migrations, to an earlier step.

A migration is a record of an update, whether it is in a database or any other type of update.

### What are the advantages of using a migration? ###

It is common for companies developing systems to have a unit with the updates, managing those updates through a handle that determines the version. This, although functional, is not manageable enough, especially if you have a large team that needs to change this unit constantly at the same time. With the migrations, each update has its own unit, giving fluidity in this development. 

In addition, updates made in this way are arranged disorganized within the source code, making it difficult to even find and identify a particular update in the future.

With migrations you have:

* Management and organization of updates.
* History of updates.
* Possibility of returning the updates.
* Greater integration between the development team.

### Why use M4D? ###

1. It´s simple.
2. It´s easy.
3. It´s free.
4. You have all the power of control of updates that a migration tool makes possible.
5. We believe that M4D has a good design enough to give the necessary flexibility to your projects.
