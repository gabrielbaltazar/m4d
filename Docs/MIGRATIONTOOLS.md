### Migration Tool ###

To create a new migration, there is a tool that streamlines this whole process.

Along with the M4D project, there is another one that can be installed, called **M4DTools**. Once installed, it enables the developer to quickly create new migrations, already in the proper format.

Once installed, create a new project and go to:

**File-> New-> Other...**

The new items screen will open. Select **"Migration for Delphi"**, and that's it. A new unit, with the basic structure for the operation of the migrations will be created.

Enjoy!
